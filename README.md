Hi! I'm <b>ATARO-QQQ!</b><br>
I'm also called "<b>Ann's syachiku-D</b>"!<br>
I live in Japan and am a suspicious person who pretends to be a <b>researcher</b>.<br>
In order to improve my <b>social psychology</b> skills, I research various things every day.<br>
I mainly use github to practice creating <b>websites</b>.<br>
I might do some <b>research</b> using websites.<br>
I'm a <b>complete beginner</b>, so I don't know much about the details, but I'll do my best.<br>
I will do my best to create a good website!<br>
